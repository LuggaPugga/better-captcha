# Auto Theme

The library automatically detects your users' system theme preference and applies it to CAPTCHA providers that don't natively support `"auto"` theme.

## How It Works

When you set `theme: "auto"`, the library detects the system theme using `prefers-color-scheme` and converts it to `"light"` or `"dark"` before passing it to the provider.

```tsx
<ReCaptcha 
  sitekey="your-site-key"
  options={{ theme: "auto" }} // Automatically detects system theme
/>
```
