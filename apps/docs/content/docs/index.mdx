`react-captcha` provides a shared React interface for popular CAPTCHA providers.   
Each widget ships as a client component that loads provider scripts safely, exposes a predictable ref handle, and keeps tokens easy to retrieve during form submissions.

## Installation

```npm
npm i react-captcha
```
