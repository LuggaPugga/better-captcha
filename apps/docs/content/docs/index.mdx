`better-captcha` provides a shared framework-agnostic interface for popular CAPTCHA providers.   
Each widget ships as a client component that loads provider scripts safely, exposes a predictable ref handle, and keeps tokens easy to retrieve during form submissions.

## Installation

### React
```npm
npm i @better-captcha/react
```

### SolidJS
```npm
npm i @better-captcha/solidjs
```

### Vue
```npm
